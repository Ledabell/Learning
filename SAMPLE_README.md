# Project 1

Project 1, a program that maintains a serach suggestion list based on movies input by the user.

* Will create a new data.txt file and use the default search list if one is not present already.
* The searches are maintained in chronological order in the suggestion list.
* Searches for movies that already exist in the list will bring that movie to the front of the list.
* The user can type "exit" as the New Lookup to end the program and save the list.
* A pre-populated search suggestion list is provided as well. To use it, delete any existing file called "data.txt" and rename the "ex_data.txt" file to "data.txt".
* Because the list is saved upon the user entering "exit", the list will not be updated for that session if the program is forcefully terminated.
